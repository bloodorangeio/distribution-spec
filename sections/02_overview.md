## Overview

### Introduction

The Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification defines an API protocol to facilitate and standardize the distribution of content, especially related to container images and associated artifacts.

### Historical Context

The spec is based on the specification for the [Docker Registry HTTP API V2 protocol](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/5cb406d511b7b9163bff9b6439072e4892e5ae3b/docs/spec/api.md).
